# Intro to HTML and CSS

## What is HTML and CSS

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- HTML and CSS are two of three front end languages
- Front end languages (client-side) is what web browsers use to translate requests and responses to the back end languages (server-side)
- Front end languages maintain a separation of concerns:
  - HTML: Structure
  - CSS: Presentation
  - JavaScript: Interaction
- Standards organization: W3C (WorldWide Web Consortium)
- JavaScript maintained by ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)
- Standards organizations maintain a vendor neutral implementation for each language
- HTML developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the late 80's/early 90's (first documented in 1991)
- CSS developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 (officially adopted in 1996)
- HTML was developed to structure and connect documents on the web
- CSS was developed to style markup documents from various sources and with cascading rules
